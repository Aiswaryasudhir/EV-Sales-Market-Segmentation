# EV-Sales-Market-Segmentation

In this project, I've undertaken a comprehensive analysis of India's electric vehicle market, with a keen focus on customer segmentation derived from electric vehicle sales spanning from 2020 to 2024 across various states in India. The study delved into both behavioral and geographic segmentation, considering factors such as the states and vehicle categories preferred by customers.
By segmenting the market, I gained valuable insights that can inform strategic decision-making for businesses operating in the electric vehicle industry. Understanding the distinct needs and preferences of each segment allows for tailored product offerings and targeted marketing strategies, ultimately driving growth and competitiveness in India's electric vehicle market.

## KMEANS CLUSTERING
 The standard k-means algorithm was applied to explore market segmentation possibilities within the electric vehicle sales data. Solutions were systematically tested for two to four market segments. The decision-making process was significantly guided by the elbow method plot, revealing a distinct elbow at four segments. This marked point indicated a substantial reduction in distances, signifying the optimal number of segments for our analysis. By incorporating insights from these analyses, our focus remained finely tuned on the three-wheeler segment, ensuring precision and relevance in our market segmentation approach
